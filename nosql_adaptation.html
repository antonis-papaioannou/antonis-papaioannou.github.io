			<h3> Adaptation policies in large-scale distributed data stores </h3>
			<br>
			<p> Operators of successful Internet-scale applications invariably see the 
			growing popularity of their services translate into the need for more data 
			capacity, higher I/O performance, and continuous operation. Data demands have 
			been growing exponentially in recent years and distributed data stores have 
			been gaining popularity as a means to addressing these needs. </p>

			<p> Rather than relying on centralized storage arrays, distributed data stores 
			consolidate large numbers of commodity servers into a single storage pool, 
			providing large capacity and high performance at low cost over an unreliable 
			and dynamically-changing (often cloud-based) infrastructure. </p>

			<p> A special class of systems goes further to offer guarantees to achieve 
			application performance goals described as Service Level Objectives (SLOs). 
			Such systems focus on identifying the performance capabilities of available 
			resources and then predict and provision the optimal set resources necessary 
			to achieve the requested performance goals. Since application requirements 
			(and thus SLOs) change over time, quality of service (QoS)-aware data stores 
			should be able to adapt to the new requirements to comply with application 
			expectations. </p>

			<p> A key question is to determine the appropriate adaptation actions that 
			maintain the same application semantics (regarding durability, availability, 
			integrity and consistency of data) model while minimizing or ideally even 
			hiding the window of performance degradation. In addition, there is usually a 
			trade-off between the duration of the adaptation actions and their performance 
			impact on the system during adaptation. Ideally, the system should be able to 
			adapt to data growth or the workload changes as quickly as possible to satisfy 
			application requirements. Nevertheless, the more aggressive the adaptation 
			action the deeper its impact on application performance, exposing a key tradeoff. 
			There are important research questions to be addressed on agile provisioning 
			and adaptation policies for large scale distributed data stores that target to 
			achieve SLOs or offer the best possible performance while ensuring the 
			durability, availability, and consistency of data. </p>

			<p> The goal of the project is to address the important research questions on 
			agile provisioning and adaptation policies for large scale distributed data 
			stores that target to achieve SLOs or offer the best possible performance. As 
			a matter of fact it is required a platform that can provide resource and support 
			the deployment of distributed data store. Multiple nodes may effectively be 
			used during the runtime of experiments by joining (or leaving) the system providing 
			elastic and adaptive features to the data store. During the experiment we should 
			be able to monitor the application performance as well as the available resource 
			utilization while the application evolves during its lifetime. </p>
